# Creating a watchface

## Designing your watchface
1. Open `Template.xml` in GIMP
    * It is already in the correct color space, so any images you import will automatically change their color.
2. Replace `Background Template` with the background for your watchface
3. Replace the tiles in `Number Template` with the tiles you want to use for the numbers. You only have to change the blocks at the top. The numbers are just for your reference.
4. You can use the sprite layers to see how your sprite will fit on the watchface
